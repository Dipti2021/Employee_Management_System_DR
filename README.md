 ## Deployed Application
 The following shows how I created this app and how it generates the file. I may make some chagnges to the code to make it more clean. But more or less, it is almost an exact representation of the code

 [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://notetakerdr.herokuapp.com/)
 
 Else we can also run the app from the terminal by running the command
 
 ```
node server
```
And then search for the localhost:2020 in your browser
