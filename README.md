 ## Introduction 
 Employee-Management-System is a __C__ ontent __M__ anagement __S__ ystem that stores the user's information in MySQL. This application is used for managing a company's employee data using Node.js, inquirer, and CRUD operations. Along with it, being a complete back end project, I added ascii art to create an introductort logo and used require module to present the output in a _Tabular form_. Also, you can run the Database in My SQL Workbench and see the same results in 2 different environments.
 In order to run the code, a lot of __npm__ commands needs to be run and the installation are as shown 
  ```
npm install
```

 ```
npm install inquirer
```

 ```
npm install mysql
```

 ```
npm install console.table
```

 ```
npm install ascii-art

```
